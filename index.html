        </header>

        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p> Since May 2016 I have been working at Deloitte UK as a Cyber Risk Consultant specialising in Identity and
            Access
            Management. My areas of focus include Digital Identity, Identity as a Service (IDaaS), cloud and DevOps.
        </p>
        <p>
            Prior to that I was employed at American Express as an Incident Response Analyst.
            In the past I
            have
            worked as a
            junior Java developer both as an intern and under 2 month contracts. As an
            intern I was responsible for creating a Java library for efficient ontology handling and management. In
            addition, while working under short-term contracts I developed middleware components in Java.</p>

        <h2>Studies</h2>
        <p>In 2015 I completed my MSc in Information Security at University College London (UCL) with a GPA of 78.83%
            (Distinction) . The course included modules such as Computer and Network Security, Cryptography, Privacy
            Enhancing Technologies, Malware and Information Security Management. In the context of my dissertation
            entitled "The Malware Schism", I developed a system capable of classifying malware samples based on their
            network behaviour.</p>
        <p>In 2014 I received my BSc in Telecommunications Science and Technology from the University of Peloponnese
            with a GPA of 8.83/10. The course included 50 modules such as Operating Systems, Java, Communication
            Networks 1&2, Distributed System Programming, Network Management and Software Engineering. My thesis,
            "Ontological Management of Security Incidents" dealt with the challenging task of mapping security incidents
            to an OWL ontology thus enabling efficient alert correlation.</p>
        <p>In July 2013, I attended the Erasmus Intensive Programme on Pervasive Networks and Service Infrastructures
            “Perseus”
            which took place in Crete. Topics included Effective Network Utilisation, Ubiquitous Access, QoS/QoE,
            Multimedia, Efficient Energy Consumption and Network Security. </p>
        <h2>Interests</h2>
        My interests include Digital Identity, Cloud, DevOps, Infrastructure as code, Computer and Network Security,
        Access Control, Security Policies, Threat Modeling, Malware
        Analysis, Traffic Analysis, Intrusion Detection, Applied Cryptography, Software Engineering, Semantic Web.
