<h2>Studies</h2>
<p>I recently completed my MSc in Information Security at University College London (UCL). The course included modules such as Computer and Network Security, Cryptography, Privacy Enhancing Technologies, Malware and Information Security Management. In the context of my dissertation entitled "The Malware Schism", I developped a system capable of classifying malware samples based on their network behaviour.</p>
<p>In 2014 I received my BSc in Telecommunications Science and Technology from the University of Peloponnese with a GPA of 8.83/10. The course included 50 modules such as Operating Systems, Java, Communication Networks 1&2, Distributed System Programming, Network Management and Software Engineering. My thesis, "Ontological Management of Security Incidents" dealt with the challenging task of mapping security incidents to an OWL ontology thus enabling efficient  alert correlation.</p>
<p>In July 2013, I attended the Erasmus Intensive Programme on Pervasive Networks and Service Infrastructures  “Perseus” 
which took place in Crete. Topics included  Effective Network Utilisation, Ubiquitous Access, QoS/QoE, Multimedia, Efficient Energy Consumption and Network Security. </p>
<h2>Experience</h2>
<p>In the past I have worked as a junior Java developper both as an intern and under 2 month contracts. As an intern I was responsible for creating a Java library for efficient ontology handling and management. In addition, while working under short-term contracts I have developped middleware components in Java.</p>
<h3>Interests</h3>
