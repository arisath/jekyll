When I tell people I am in Information Security, they typically ask me "I am using this and that blah blah, is my system secure?" and the seem really surprised when I tell them "I do not know, I can not tell you". The truth is I can not tell them, at least not unless they tell me what is their security policy and what is their threat model.
