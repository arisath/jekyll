The definition I personally believe fits Malware most is "software executed in ignorance of the user performing some unwanted activity". This article presents some of the most popular malware categories, including but not limited to Adware, Spyware and Ransomware.
Adware
Adware refers to programs that deliver advertising content in a manner or context that
is unexpected and unwanted by users. It is quite common for Adware to be confused with  PUPs (potentially unwanted
programs). However there exists a fine line between the two categories. PUPs are typically installed along with a freeware program but their installation required the explicit consent of the user. On the other hand, Adware programs trick the
user into thinking that he is installing a useful program but contain hidden advertising components.
