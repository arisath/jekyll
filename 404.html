   In our example, the user wants to download the well-known browser Firefox. The user does not know where to download Firefox from, so he goes to Bing to search for it.
   <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/adwareBlog/Bing.jpg" width="650" height="350" align="middle">
  </p>

  I suggest that you head <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}">Home</a>.
 </section></div>
