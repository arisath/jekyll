<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>Online advertising tends to be one of the best ways for promotion and advertising in our days. The more targeted an advertisement is, the more efficient and attractive could also be to the end user. On the other hand, Internet targeted advertising is mostly based on user's personal information such as profiling, Internet habits, history, etc, even if part of such information could be characterized as private. Thus, gathering and analyzing users' information might raise serious privacy concerns. This paper presents a privacy-aware, ontology-based middleware architecture enabling information collection and analysis coming from real-time communication (i.e. chat applications) and triggering third party advertising servers, in order to achieve targeted advertising relevant to the real-time content.</p>
